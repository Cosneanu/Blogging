Excel is a powerful tool for data management, analysis, and reporting. However, navigating through large spreadsheets and performing repetitive tasks can be time-consuming. 
To boost your efficiency and save precious hours, mastering Excel shortcuts is essential. In this blog post, we'll explore 20 Excel shortcuts, including the ones you provided,
with practical examples to help you supercharge your Excel skills.

1. Freeze the Top Line (Alt + W + F + R):

Freezing the top row in Excel can make scrolling through extensive datasets more manageable. To do this, simply press Alt + W + F + R. This keeps your headers visible, even as you
scroll down, making it easier to reference column names and data.

Example:
Imagine you have a sales data spreadsheet with headers in row 1. By freezing the top row, you can always see which column represents which information, making data entry and analysis
more efficient.

2. Navigate to the Last Cell (Ctrl + Any Arrow Key):

Excel shortcuts for navigation can save you a lot of time. Pressing Ctrl along with any arrow key will take you to the last cell in that direction. This is especially useful in large 
worksheets.

Example:
To quickly reach the last populated cell in a column, select any cell in that column and press Ctrl + Down Arrow. This instantly takes you to the bottom-most cell with data.

3. Copy a Left Cell (Ctrl + R):

Copying data from the cell to the left can be achieved with Ctrl + R. This can speed up data entry when you have similar data across adjacent cells.

Example:
Suppose you have a formula in cell B2 that you want to copy to cell C2. Select C2, press Ctrl + R, and Excel will copy the formula from B2 into C2.

4. AutoComplete Text (Alt + Down Arrow):

When you want to insert text that's already present in your worksheet, use Alt + Down Arrow to access AutoComplete. This feature suggests possible text matches, saving you from manual
typing and potential errors.

Example:
If you have a list of product names in column A and want to insert one into a cell, simply type the first few letters and press Alt + Down Arrow to see a dropdown of matching options.

5. Select Rows or Columns (Ctrl or Shift + Space):

Effortlessly select entire rows or columns by using Ctrl + Space (for columns) or Shift + Space (for rows). This can be helpful for formatting, deletion, or data manipulation.

Example:
To select an entire row, click on any cell within that row and press Shift + Space. The whole row will be highlighted and ready for action.

6. Split Text in a Cell (Alt + Enter):

When dealing with lengthy text in a single cell, Alt + Enter allows you to split it into multiple lines, improving readability and formatting.

Example:
In a cell containing an address like "123 Main Street, City, State," place your cursor where you want to split the text and press Alt + Enter. This separates the address into multiple
lines for clarity.

7. Add Comments Quickly (Shift + F2):

Comments can provide context to your data. To add a comment to a cell without using the mouse, select the cell and press Shift + F2. This speeds up the annotation process.

Example:
Select a cell and press Shift + F2 to add a comment explaining the data in that cell.

8. Go to a Specific Cell (Ctrl + G):

Navigating to a specific cell in a large worksheet can be time-consuming. Use Ctrl + G to open the "Go To" dialog box, where you can enter the cell reference you want to jump to.

Example:
Press Ctrl + G, enter "A1," and hit Enter to quickly navigate to cell A1.

9. Center Text Across Selection (Ctrl + E):

Ctrl + E is a handy shortcut for centering text across a selection of cells. It can be a useful formatting tool.

Example:
Select a range of cells and press Ctrl + E to center-align text across those cells without merging them.

10. AutoSum (Alt + Equal Sign):

Excel offers a quick way to sum numbers using Alt + Equal Sign. Select a cell below a column of numbers, and Excel will automatically create a SUM formula for you.

Example:
Select a cell beneath a column of numbers, press Alt + Equal Sign, and Excel will generate a SUM formula for the selected range.

11. Paste Special (Ctrl + Alt + V):

When pasting data, Ctrl + Alt + V opens the Paste Special dialog, giving you various options for pasting, such as values, formats, or formulas.

Example:
Copy a cell, select another cell, press Ctrl + Alt + V, and choose the desired paste option from the Paste Special dialog.

12. Find and Replace (Ctrl + H):

Ctrl + H is a shortcut for the Find and Replace feature. It's a powerful tool for quickly replacing text or values throughout your worksheet.

Example:
Press Ctrl + H, enter the text you want to find and replace, and specify the replacement text and options to make changes across your worksheet.

13. Create Tables and Use Slicers (Ctrl + T):

Ctrl + T is the shortcut to create tables in Excel. Tables simplify data management and analysis. Additionally, you can add slicers to filter data within tables easily.

Example:
Select a range of data, press Ctrl + T to create a table, and then use the Insert Slicer option to add slicers for quick data filtration.

14. Use the LARGE Function for Top Lists:

To quickly find the top values in a dataset, use the LARGE function. This function returns the nth largest value in a range.

Example:
Suppose you have a list of sales figures in column A. To find the top three sales figures, use the formula =LARGE(A1:A100, 1), =LARGE(A1:A100, 2), and =LARGE(A1:A100, 3).

15. Convert Text to Columns (Alt + T + U + T):

Alt + T + U + T opens the Text to Columns wizard. This is invaluable when you need to split text in a cell into multiple columns.

Example:
Select a cell containing text that needs to be split, press Alt + T + U + T, and follow the steps in the Text to Columns wizard to separate the text into columns.

16. Show Formulas (Formulas Tab > Show Formulas):

To view all formulas in your worksheet at once, go to the Formulas tab and click "Show Formulas." This is particularly useful for debugging complex spreadsheets.

Example:
Navigate to the Formulas tab, click "Show Formulas," and Excel will display all formulas in your worksheet instead of the calculated results.

17. Quickly Format Numbers (Ctrl + Shift + $):

Ctrl + Shift + $ is a shortcut for applying the Currency format to selected cells. It's handy when dealing with financial data.

Example:
Select a range of cells with numbers and press Ctrl + Shift + $ to format them as currency.

18. Fill Down (Ctrl + D) and Fill Right (Ctrl + R):

Ctrl + D fills down the content of the topmost cell in a selected column, while Ctrl + R fills right from the leftmost cell in a selected row.

Example:
To quickly copy the value from cell A1 to the entire column, select A1 and press Ctrl + D.

19. AutoFit Column Width

 (Alt + H + O + I):

AutoFit column width ensures that your data is displayed completely within each column. Use Alt + H + O + I to apply this formatting to a selected column.

Example:
Select a column, press Alt + H + O + I, and Excel will adjust the column width to fit the content perfectly.

20. Insert Current Date (Ctrl + ;):

To insert the current date into a cell, press Ctrl + ; (semi-colon). This is useful for tracking when data was entered or last updated.

Example:
Select a cell where you want to insert the current date and press Ctrl + ; to add the date instantly.
